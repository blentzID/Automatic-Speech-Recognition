# AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION

## OVERVIEW
Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech-to-text, is a capability that enables a program to process human speech into a written format.
While speech recognition is commonly confused with voice recognition, speech recognition focuses on the translation of speech from a verbal format to a text one whereas voice recognition just seeks to identify an individual user’s voice. (https://www.ibm.com/topics/speech-recognition#:~:text=Speech%20recognition%2C%20also%20known%20as,speech%20into%20a%20written%20format.)


## DATASET
The dataset used is minds14 (https://huggingface.co/datasets/PolyAI/minds14).  
This dataset has 8168 audio and true transcrptions pair.

## AUDIO ANALYSIS
When dealing with audio data, several audio processing techniques can be employed, e.g. spectrogram, etc, which is used as the input feature for the model later.  
Some of these convert the audio data to the frequency domain.

## PREPROCESSING
For simplicity, only the English audio is used for this task.

The preprocessing is as following
1. Train - test split: 90-10 ratio
2. The audio data is preprocessed following the pretrained model's configuration


The evaluation uses Word Error Rate (WER) and accuracy.
The calculation for the accuracy is:

## CONCLUSION
1. Among three pretrained models explored, the best result is using Whisper V3 Large, which achieves accuracy score of 72.95% and WER of 0.27
2. The transcription generated by each model is able to capture the key words in the audio, although not perfectly fits to the true transcription.

Improvement idea:
1. The sampling rate of the pretrained models is 16k Hz, whereas the sampling rate of the audio in the Minds-14 dataset is 8k Hz. Upsampling the audio may improve the result
2. Fine tune the pretrained model on the Minds-14 dataset


This automatic speech recognition task is part of the projects done during NLP bootcamp at Indonesia AI.
